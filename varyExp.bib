@book{JacodShiryaev,
abstract = {{Initially the theory of convergence in law of stochastic processes was developed quite independently from the theory of martingales, semimartingales and stochastic integrals. Apart from a few exceptions essentially concerning diffusion processes, it is only recently that the relation between the two theories has been thoroughly studied. The authors of this Grundlehren volume, two of the international leaders in the field, propose a systematic exposition of convergence in law for stochastic processes, from the point of view of semimartingale theory, with emphasis on results that are useful for mathematical theory and mathematical statistics. This leads them to develop in detail some particularly useful parts of the general theory of stochastic processes, such as martingale problems, and absolute continuity or contiguity results. The book contains an introduction to the theory of martingales and semimartingales, random measures stochastic integrales, Skorokhod topology, etc., as well as a large number of results which have never appeared in book form, and some entirely new results. The second edition contains some additions to the text and references. Some parts are completely rewritten.}},

abstract = {The mathematical description of diffusion has a long history with many different formulations including phenomenological models based on conservation of mass and constitutive laws; probabilistic models based on random walks and central limit theorems; microscopic stochastic models based on Brownian motion and Langevin equations; and mesoscopic stochastic models based on master equations and Fokker–Planck equations. A fundamental result common to the different approaches is that the mean square displacement of a diffusing particle scales linearly with time. However there have been numerous experimental measurements in which the mean square displacement of diffusing particles scales as a fractional order power law in time. In recent years a great deal of progress has been made in extending the different models for diffusion to incorporate this fractional diffusion. The tools of fractional calculus have proven very useful in these developments, linking together fractional constitutive laws, continuous time random walks, fractional Langevin equations and fractional Brownian motions. These notes provide a tutorial style overview of standard and fractional diffusion processes.},

abstract = {Many physical processes appear to exhibit fractional order behavior that may vary with time or space. The continuum of order in the fractional calculus allows the order of the fractional operator to be considered as a variable. This paper develops the concept of variable and distributed order fractional operators. Definitions based on the Riemann-Liouville definitions are introduced and behavior of the operators is studied. Several time domain definitions that assign different arguments to the order q in the Riemann-Liouville definition are introduced. For each of these definitions various characteristics are determined. These include: time invariance of the operator, operator initialization, physical realization, linearity, operational transforms. and memory characteristics of the defining kernels. A measure (m2) for memory retentiveness of the order history is introduced. A generalized linear argument for the order q allows the concept of "tailored" variable order fractional operators whose a, memory may be chosen for a particular application. Memory retentiveness (m2) and order dynamic behavior are investigated and applications are shown. The concept of distributed order operators where the order of the time based operator depends on an additional independent (spatial) variable is also forwarded. Several definitions and their Laplace transforms are developed, analysis methods with these operators are demonstrated, and examples shown. Finally operators of multivariable and distributed order are defined in their various applications are outlined.},

abstract = {The crowded intracellular environment poses a formidable challenge to experimental and theoretical analyses of intracellular transport mechanisms. Our measurements of single-particle trajectories in cytoplasm and their random-walk interpretations elucidate two of these mechanisms: molecular diffusion in crowded environments and cytoskeletal transport along microtubules. We employed acousto-optic deflector microscopy to map out the three-dimensional trajectories of microspheres migrating in the cytosolic fraction of a cellular extract. Classical Brownian motion (BM), continuous time random walk, and fractional BM were alternatively used to represent these trajectories. The comparison of the experimental and numerical data demonstrates that cytoskeletal transport along microtubules and diffusion in the cytosolic fraction exhibit anomalous (nonFickian) behavior and posses statistically distinct signatures. Among the three random-walk models used, continuous time random walk provides the best representation of diffusion, whereas microtubular transport is accurately modeled with fractional BM. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {We show how the nonlinear interaction effects 'volume filling' and 'adhesion' can be incorporated into the fractional subdiffusive transport of cells and individual organisms. To this end, we use microscopic random walk models with anomalous trapping and systematically derive generic non-Markovian and nonlinear governing equations for the mean concentrations of the subdiffusive cells or organisms. We uncover an interesting interaction between the nonlinearities and the non-Markovian nature of the transport. In the subdiffusive case, this interaction manifests itself in a nontrivial combination of nonlinear terms with fractional derivatives. In the long time limit, however, these equations simplify to a form without fractional operators. This provides an easy method for the study of aggregation phenomena. In particular, this enables us to show that volume filling can prevent "anomalous aggregation," which occurs in subdiffusive systems with a spatially varying anomalous exponent.},

abstract = {While several high-order methods have been developed for fractional PDEs (FPDEs) with fixed order, there are no such methods for FPDEs with field-variable order. These equations allow multiphysics simulations seamlessly, e.g. from diffusion to sub-diffusion or from wave dynamics transitioning to diffusion, by simply varying the fractional order as a function of space or time. We develop an exponentially accurate fractional spectral collocation method for solving linear/nonlinear FPDEs with field-variable order. Following the spectral theory, developed in [1] for fractional Sturm–Liouville eigenproblems, we intro-duce a new family of interpolants, called left-/right-sided and central fractional Lagrange interpolants. We employ the fractional derivatives of (left-/right-sided) Riemann–Liouville and Riesz type and obtain the corresponding fractional differentiation matrices by collocating the field-variable fractional orders. We solve several FPDEs including time-and space-fractional advection-equation, time-and space-fractional advection–diffusion equation, and finally the space-fractional Burgers' equation to demonstrate the performance of the method. In addition, we develop a spectral penalty method for enforcing inhomoge-neous initial conditions. Our numerical results confirm the exponential-like convergence of the proposed fractional collocation methods.},

Tempered fractional diffusion equations, where the usual second derivative in space is replaced by a tempered fractional derivative, govern the limits of random walk models with an exponentially tempered power law jump distribution. The limiting tempered stable probability densities exhibit semi-heavy tails, which are commonly observed in finance. Tempered power law waiting times lead to tempered fractional time derivatives, which have proven useful in geophysics. The tempered fractional derivative or integral of a Brownian motion, called a tempered fractional Brownian motion, can exhibit semi-long range dependence. The increments of this process, called tempered fractional Gaussian noise, provide a useful new stochastic model for wind speed data. A tempered fractional difference forms the basis for numerical methods to solve tempered fractional diffusion equations, and it also provides a useful new correlation model in time series.},

Some applications require an overshoot continuous time random walk (OCTRW), where the waiting time is coupled to the previous jump.

abstract = {We consider subdiffusive scaling limits of Continuous Time Random Walks (CTRWs), in the case where the distribution of the waiting times and thus the resulting memory kernel varies with the location in space. We first establish a one-to-one correspondence between CTRW limit processes and Langevin processes in space-time. In this space-time representation, the evolution of the waiting times is readily governed by varying their L\'evy measure and drift in space. In the case of fractional diffusion and tempered fractional diffusion, this can be expressed via a varying fractional parameter $\beta(x) \in (0,1)$ and/or a varying tempering parameter $\theta(x) \ge 0$, as well as a varying "temporal drift" parameter $d(x) \ge 0$. We then use a result from the mathematics literature which identifies the probability distributions of a CTRW limit process with the unique solution of a Fokker-Planck equation with memory. We then focus on the situation where the CTRW dynamics are locally fractional with parameter $\beta(x)$. We rigorously derive the variable order fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE) from the CTRW limit. This equation displays a unique temporal scaling behaviour: given a time scale parameter $T_0$, the factor $T_0^{-\beta(x)}$ enters in both the drift and diffusivity coefficients of the Fokker-Planck operator. We present Monte Carlo simulations which show that solutions to the variable order FFPE are consistent at different time scales.},

The "Ariadne's clew" we follow is understanding of the general statistical mechanisms which may generate "anomalous" (non-Brownian) diffusion laws; this allows us to develop simple arguments to obtain a qualitative (but often quite accurate) picture of most situations. Several analytical techniques-such as the Green function formalism and renormalization group methods-are also exposed. Care is devoted to the problem of sample to sample fluctuations, particularly acute here. We consider the specific effects of a bias on anomalous diffusion, and discuss the generalizations of Einstein's relation in the presence of disorder. An effort is made to illustrate the theoretical models by describing many physical situations where anomalous diffusion laws have been-or could be-observed. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

For a given CTRW limit process $X(t)$, a sequence of discrete CTRWs in discrete time is given which converges to $X(t)$ (weakly in the Skorokhod topology). Master equations for the discrete CTRWs are implemented numerically, thus approximating the distribution of $X(t)$. A consequence of the derived algorithm is that any distribution of initial age can be assumed as an initial condition for the CTRW limit dynamics. Four examples with different temporal scaling are discussed: subdiffusion, tempered subdiffusion, the fractal mobile/immobile model and the tempered fractal mobile/immobile model.},

abstract = {We combined local photolysis of caged compounds with fluorescence imaging to visualize molecular diffusion within dendrites of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Diffusion of a volume marker, fluorescein dextran, within spiny dendrites was remarkably slow in comparison to its diffusion in smooth dendrites. Computer simulations indicate that this retardation is due to a transient trapping of molecules within dendritic spines, yielding anomalous diffusion. We considered the influence of spine trapping on the diffusion of calcium ions (Ca(2+)) and inositol-1,4,5-triphospate (IP(3)), two synaptic second messengers. Diffusion of IP(3) was strongly influenced by the presence of dendritic spines, while Ca(2+) was removed so rapidly that it could not diffuse far enough to be trapped. We conclude that an important function of dendritic spines may be to trap chemical signals and thereby create slowed anomalous diffusion within dendrites.},

When the diffusion is anomalous we find interesting behavior: diffusion may lead to an averaged net drift x from one material to another even if all particles eventually flow in the opposite direction. Furthermore, x does not depend on the properties of the medium in which it is situated, indicating nonlocality of the process. Starting with an underlying continuous time random walk model we solve diffusion equations describing this problem. Similar drift against flow is found in the quenched trap model. We argue that such behavior is a general feature of diffusion in disordered systems.},

abstract = {We have introduced a set of coupled fractional reaction-diffusion equations to model a multispecies system undergoing anomalous subdiffusion with linear reaction dynamics. The model equations are derived from a mesoscopic continuous time random walk formulation of anomalously diffusing species with linear mean field reaction kinetics. The effect of reactions is manifest in reaction modified spatiotemporal diffusion operators as well as in additive mean field reaction terms. One consequence of the nonseparability of reaction and subdiffusion terms is that the governing evolution equation for the concentration of one particular species may include both reactive and diffusive contributions from other species. The general solution is derived for the multispecies system and some particular special cases involving both irreversible and reversible reaction dynamics are analyzed in detail. We have carried out Monte Carlo simulations corresponding to these special cases and we find excellent agreement with theory.},

abstract = {We have studied the diffusion of tracer proteins in highly concentrated random-coil polymer and globular protein solutions imitating the crowded conditions encountered in cellular environments. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we measured the anomalous diffusion exponent alpha characterizing the dependence of the mean-square displacement of the tracer proteins on time, r(2)(t) approximately t(alpha). We observed that the diffusion of proteins in dextran solutions with concentrations up to 400 g/l is subdiffusive (alpha < 1) even at low obstacle concentration. The anomalous diffusion exponent alpha decreases continuously with increasing obstacle concentration and molecular weight, but does not depend on buffer ionic strength, and neither does it depend strongly on solution temperature. At very high random-coil polymer concentrations, alpha reaches a limit value of alpha(l) approximately 3/4, which we take to be the signature of a coupling between the motions of the tracer proteins and the segments of the dextran chains. A similar, although less pronounced, subdiffusive behavior is observed for the diffusion of streptavidin in concentrated globular protein solutions. These observations indicate that protein diffusion in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus should be anomalous as well, with consequences for measurements of solute diffusion coefficients in cells and for the modeling of cellular processes relying on diffusion.},

@article{Wong04,
abstract = {We study the thermal motion of colloidal tracer particles in entangled actin filament (F-actin) networks, where the particle radius is comparable to the mesh size of the F-actin network. In this regime, the ensemble-averaged mean-squared displacement of the particles is proportional to , where 0 < < 1 from 0:1 < < 100 s and depends only on the ratio of the probe radius to mesh size. By directly imaging hundreds of particles over 20 min, we determine this anomalous subdiffusion is due to the dynamics of infrequent and large jumps particles make between distinct pores in the network. The cytoskeleton is composed of dense actin filament (F-actin) networks that regulate many important cellular processes such as cell shape, motility, and division [1]. The mechanical properties of these networks control proper biological function, but these mechanical proper-ties are challenging to measure in vivo and are difficult to model theoretically as the details of cytoskeletal micro-structure are not well understood [2,3]. This has moti-vated an extensive effort to measure the mechanical properties and microstructure of reconstituted F-actin networks in vitro [4 –9]. F-actin is a semiflexible polymer, which is characterized by a persistence length of 10–20 m, roughly 3 orders of magnitude larger than the filament diameter of 7 nm [10,11]. In vitro, the con-tour length of F-actin filaments is typically greater than 20 m, and semidilute solutions of actin form entangled networks of semiflexible polymers with an average mesh size, , of order 100 nm to 1 m. Thus, solutions of en-tangled F-actin are an ideal model system with which to study the unique dynamics and mechanical properties of semiflexible polymer networks and to investigate the implications of the underlying mechanisms of these prop-erties for the behavior of the cytoskeleton. The unique mechanical properties of F-actin networks are determined by structures and dynamics on the scale of microns. Thus, full elucidation of these properties demands techniques that probe the behavior at these length scales; this has inspired the development of micro-rheological methods, where the motion of micron-sized tracer particles, driven by thermal, magnetic, or optical forces, is used to make precise local measurements of viscosity and mechanical properties at the length scale of the tracer particle [4 –9,12–14]. When the particle radius, a, is much smaller than , the one-dimensional mean-squared displacement (MSD), hx 2 i, of the tracer, particles evolves linearly in time, hx 2 i  2D. In this case, the particle motion is sensitive to the local viscosity of the solvent and reflects the effect of macro-molecular crowding [15,16] as well as hydrodynamic interactions with the network [5,17], both of which de-crease the measured diffusion constant, D. By contrast, when a is larger than , the particles are constrained by the surrounding polymer network, and the bead motions directly reflect the local elasticity of the network [6,8,14]. In the intermediate case, when a , the particle motion should directly probe the network dynamics and mechan-ics at the scale of a, the critical length scale for important network properties; unfortunately, very little is known about particle motion when a . In this Letter, we show that particle motion in F-actin networks with a does indeed directly reflect the dynamics of the local microstructure of the network. The ensemble-averaged MSD of particles exhibits anomalous subdiffusive behavior, hx 2 i , where 0 < < 1, over a wide range of lag times, . Remarkably, the diffusive exponent, , is a function only of the ratio of the particle radius to the mesh size and can be tuned from one to zero over a narrow range 0:42 < a= < 1:25. This subdiffusive behavior is due to the surprising dynamics of individual particles; they remain trapped within a local-ized ''cage'' of actin filaments, but can infrequently ''jump'' between different cages. The temporal distribu-tion of these jumps results in the anomalous subdiffusion and reveals new insights into the length scale dependent dynamics of the entangled F-actin microstructure.

Two explicit formulae for the density function are developed, and applied to compute explicit solutions to tempered fractional Cauchy problems, where a tempered fractional derivative replaces the first derivative in time. Several examples are given, including tempered fractional diffusion equations on bounded or unbounded domains, and the probability distribution of a tempered fractional Poisson process.

@article{Angstmann2015a,
abstract = {The continuous time random walk, introduced in the physics literature by Montroll and Weiss, has been widely used to model anomalous diffusion in external force fields. One of the features of this model is that the governing equations for the evolution of the probability density function, in the diffusion limit, can generally be simplified using fractional calculus. This has in turn led to intensive research efforts over the past decade to develop robust numerical methods for the governing equations, represented as fractional partial differential equations. Here we introduce a discrete time random walk that can also be used to model anomalous diffusion in an external force field. The governing evolution equations for the probability density function share the continuous time random walk diffusion limit. Thus the discrete time random walk provides a novel numerical method for solving anomalous diffusion equations in the diffusion limit, including the fractional Fokker-Planck equation. This method has the clear advantage that the discretisation of the diffusion limit equation, which is necessary for numerical analysis, is itself a well defined physical process. Some examples using the discrete time random walk to provide numerical solutions of the probability density function for anomalous subdiffusion, including forcing, are provided.
